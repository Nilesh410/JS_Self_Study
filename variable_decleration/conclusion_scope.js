/*
1) var 
   -> var is global scope and functional scope
   -> we can access var variable before decleration and initalization due to hoisting
   -> we can reinitialize var variable in same scope
   -> we can redeclare the var variable with same name in same scope

2) let 
   -> let has block scope 
   -> block scope varible can not access before decleration due to TDZ
   -> it can reinitialize in the same scope 
   -> but we can not redeclare in the same scope with same name

3) const:-
   -> same as let variable 
   -> but only difference is we can not reinitalize or change the value of const variable
